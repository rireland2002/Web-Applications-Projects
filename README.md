# Web-Applications-Projects
Two in one project upload of a website recreation and a workbook covering DOM content and web efficiency.

Two in one project upload. First project is a workbook that dives into DOM content and how to handle the loading of assets when considering the load times of users when accessing certain sites. Touches on other previously covered concepts such as DNS and how this affects load times. Second project involved recreating a website to a set of parameters designated by Lancaster University. Focused on responsive web design. Fulled growing interest in web design and web application development, module was an optional choice taken on out of personal interest.
